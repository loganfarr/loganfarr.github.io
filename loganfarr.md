Living happily where leadership and software development meet, I can give the best of both worlds. 10 years of experience in web development across the entire stack gives me a wealth of technical information to build the best, scalable, most cost-efficient solution for you.

I'm self-taught on almost all of my technical skills, and have gone through numerous leadership trainings to hone my management and coaching abilities. I always strive to be better through feedback loops, continuing education, and building my network.

Angela Duckworth writes in her book _Grit_, "most of your actions derive their significance from their allegiance to your ultimate concern, your life philosophy." This sent me on a journey to find my life philosophy, something that gave me drive and passion. Fortunately, it didn't take long to find it. 

### I help people reach their full potential.

This may be in individual growth, or it may be in the form of a product. This is why I work at the cross-section of engineering and leadership. This is why I am passionate about understanding people, about helping others grow.

## As a leader
I work hard to create a team culture that promotes honesty, trust, healthy conflict, and both the growth of the team and the individual. I believe that people are at the heart of everything, and as the most valuable asset a company can have, should be treated with respect and encouragement.

There are many things that make a team great, but there are three that rise to the top, trust, communication, and emotional intelligence. These traits within a team bring out the best in people, resulting in healthy debates and new ideas. Everyone comes from a different background, a different culture, and it is important to ensure that everyone is heard, that everyone is taken seriously.

Things like "healthy conflict" and "emotional intelligence" aren't something easy to learn, they must be experienced and continuously studied. I coach team members through various topics like emotional literacy and mindful living. These skills combined with something I like to call _deliberate work_*, create an empowered and growing environment.

## As an engineer
Technology has always been a love of mine for as long as I can remmeber. Remember in the 90s, when families had a "computer room," where their bulky PC with CRT monitor were stored? I remember as a child I was fascinated with the CD drive. I couldn't figure out how it worked. So, what did little Logan do? I formed Play-Doh into a disk and tried to cram it in the drive to see how the drive interacted with the Play-Doh. (Something about being able to see the striations? 5-year-old logic.) This, of course, ruined the drive, and the mystery eluded me. 

I've kept that same spirit of curiosity (albeit, much less destructive) throughout my life. I have honed my learning agility so that I may pick up new frameworks and languages with ease. This allows me to quickly pick something up, and build things that previously were not possible.   

Everything I know has been self-taught, and I continue to push the barrier every day.

### Languages
PHP, C#/.NET Core, JavaScript/jQuery, HTML, CSS, XML, LESS/SCSS

### Frameworks & tools
AWS, Node.js, Angular, REST & SOAP APIs, XSS prevention

## As a team member
As my peer, or really anytime you're on a team with me, you can expect a few things. 
- Honesty & transparency; I will always give you the truth, no matter how bad or uncomfortable.
- 100% effort, every day; If you have me, you have all of me (and my skill-set). 
- Understanding and support; Everyone is human, after all. Things come up, mistakes happen. At the end of the day, what matters is that everyone is happy and supported in whatever way the team can provide to each other.

### Things you will regularly hear from me
"Is there anything I can do to help you feel less stressed?"<br />
"I would be happy to walk you through it and answer any questions that come up."<br />
"I'm sorry, I don't understand. Can we try reviewing this differently?"

# Experience
## Cricut, <a href="https://cricut.com">cricut.com</a>
### **Engineering manager, ecommerce**
#### June 2019 &ndash; present
I lead the ecommerce engineering team, made up of 9+ engineers in both North America and across the world. Together, we build and maintain Cricut.com. We work with product managers, marketing teams, creative design teams, and our follow engineers to provide a world-class ecommerce experience.

As a team, we have integrated additional payment gateways, increased deliverability of online orders through verification steps, expanded internationally in both product selection and currency, and supported a very large subscription business.

As a leader, among other things, I have worked to define change management processes, build a team culture that promotes growth and trust, and build (and improve!) daily processes to ensure a reliable, swift software development cycle. I work with our technical recruiters to screen and interview candidates, both for technical skill and team culture fit.

Some other highlights
- Managed a Magento community site that helps support a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue every quarter (not to mention a rapidly-growing user base)
- Worked hand-in-hand with business units to provide transparent reporting for various executive and leadership teams
- Built tools for cross-functional teams to monitor and act on data trends, in both site performance and general order fulfillment.
- Coordinated with our finance teams to ensure financial reporting is accurate and accounted for, all the way to order fulfillment.
- Connected with our Member Care department regularly to ensure that we were addressing the correct issues to reduce call drivers
- Upload the Cricut value of "frugality", ensuring that all the work we do from both operating expenses and continued development is cost-efficient and stays within defined guidelines.
- Contributed to code on a regular basis while balancing my managerial duties (see Cricut GitHub link)

### **Software engineer**
I was a part of our Magento software engineering team, where we manage Cricut's Magento 2 eCommerce site and all the integrations that go with it. We work with product managers, marketing teams, creative design teams, and our follow engineers to provide a world-class ecommerce experience.


#### **Manager, front-end engineering**
I managed a small team of developers, including the team workload, day-to-day tasks, communication with other departments, and mediating between people when necessary.

I was also involved with interviewing prospective employees and helping make decisions on how to build and grow the team. These decisions often included factors such as technical ability, culture fit, and how well the employee in question could work with others in the broader team.

My team built cricut.com, was in charge of updating and maintaining the content on shop.cricut.com, and is responsible for coding the email newsletters and campaigns that go out to our consumers. I also managed the Cricut Learn site and Help 


#### **Front-end engineer**
I joined the front-end engineering team in the Creative department in April 2016. Our team collaborates closely with direct-to-consumer (DTC) marketing, UX, Visual Design, channel marketing, and product teams.

My first large project was helping finish the build for the Cricut Help Center on Drupal 8. My role was primarily front-end, building on the theme that was there. Afterwards, I worked with the product team to come up with the Learn site, which, with the help of a custom module, provides users with “playlists” of tutorials so people can learn how to use their Cricut machine and the accessories that come with it.

In June 2016, I was placed as the project lead on the Criuct.com rebuild project. We were responsible for transitioning cricut.com from Sitefinity 5.4 to Drupal 7. This involved a large content migration, a custom theme, and a custom site build.

My team’s primary function is to update our ecommerce site with the latest promotions and creative, maintain cricut.com, and code the email newsletters to blast out to our subscribing consumers. We are expected to work under tight timelines and be flexible in our work.
